# Advent of Code 2019 solved with Elixir

So [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is back, and this year I thought I'd take the opportunity to stretch my code wings with a language that makes me uncomfortable: [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

I've used Elixir only once, a few years ago, for a tiny [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)-based API. The language’s bizarre elegance intrigued me; its lack of common programming features like `for` and `while` loops is offset by pattern-matching, pipelines, and immutability. I haven't written enough Elixir code to become comfortable with these strange new tools, but they’re foreign enough to be interesting—and who knows what other [unknown unknowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns) are lurking beyond my field of view?

Anyway, I'm hoping that a month of struggling with Elixir will expand my conception of what programming can be, in the same way that Ruby and Clojure did. So, onward to the code:

## Instructions

Really simple, actually (assuming that Elixir is [installed on your system](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)):

1. Solving the day’s problem:

    `elixir day-01.exs`

2. Running tests:

    `elixir -r day-01.exs day-01-test.exs`
